# draft-js-format-plugin
My custom version of the draft-js-format-plugin

# Code provided only for example
This is using jQuery and some custom SCSS. The custom SCSS won't work outside of the project it's part of.

You are welcome to take this code and modify it to suit your needs. One day I will work with NikGraf on getting this fully integrated with the draft-js-plugins project.
